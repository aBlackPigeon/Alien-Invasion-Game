# 🚀 Alien Invasion

Alien Invasion is a 2D arcade-style game built using **Python** and **Pygame**.  
The player controls a spaceship that can move left and right across the bottom of the screen, firing bullets upward to destroy descending aliens.  

This project is based on the book *Python Crash Course* by Eric Matthes, with custom modifications.
